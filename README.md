# CSCI-4650---Numerical-Analysis-I

A first-semester course in numerical methods and analysis fundamental to many algorithms encountered in scientific computing, data science, machine learning, and computational models in science and engineering. Rounding errors and numerical stability of algorithms; solution of linear and nonlinear equations; data modeling with interpolation and least-squares; and optimization methods.

Prereq: MATH 3195 -  Linear Algebra and Differential Equations  (4 Credits)  

# Course Goals
Completion of this course has provided myself with
1. An understanding of the basic theory of solving mathematical problems with computers while being cognizant of
floating-point arithmetic including issues of overflow and underflow.
2. Knowledge of the different issues surrounding errors in numerical methods, including machine epsilon, error
analysis, convergence, rounding, truncation, and norms.
3. An appreciation of the difficulties involved in finding reliable solutions as well as be able to apply various methods for
estimating errors in solutions to judge how reliable those solutions are.
4. An awareness of conditioning of problems and algorithms' stability and the distinction between the two.
